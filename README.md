# Tinamou phylogenomics
This repository contains scripts and code for Musher et al. (in review)
Folder details:
"genetrees" contains files with all collapsed gene trees in a single file for each dataset
"phylonet" contains input and output files for phylonet
"RF.distances" contains a script for replicating several statistics and figures in the manuscript, "PIS_rf_dist_collapsed.R", output tables, and alignment/genetree files for each dataset
"Trees" contains all concatenated and astral phylogenies for each dataset. Those with prefix "concord" contain gene concordance values at all nodes
Table S1 is the supplementary table 1 referenced in the article text containing a list of samples used in the study
Table S6 is a table of clade ages
Tinamou_assembly_pipeline.txt is a list of commands used for bioinformatic assembly of tinamou whole genomes
"MSCquartets.R" is a script that will replicate quartet analyses for assessing the effect of ILS
